There are 3 diagrams presented.

Tower Diagram: Shows the towers that the player can deploy. Some are stationary, some automatically move around, but all fire projectiles (which is its own class).The Home base is also a tower, but without any defensive capabilities. Once it receives a certain number of hits, it will automatically end the game. The standalone projectile
class represents projectiles fired out of defensive towers. All defensive towers shoot the same object. The attributes
vary however (pierce power, speed, Area of Effect, etc.).


Enemy Diagram: Presents enemies. There are 2 kinds of enemies. Celestial bodies like asteroids go and crash into our towers and home base and do a lot of damage, but are destroyed on contact. The other towers actually persist and 
continue to attack (or spawn other towers) until destroyed.

Economy Diagram: Lays out the crafting system. It shows how raw materials can be crafted into intermediate materials
which can be crafted into full fledged towers.
