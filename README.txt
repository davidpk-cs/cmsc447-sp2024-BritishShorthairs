Current Phase - Sprint 1 (requirement analysis and planning)

Our game is a space based tower defense game where you are a contractor who
has to protect our home planet against hordes of UFOs and asteroids. All the documents
related to planning are in this repository.

Activity Diagrams - Lays out how the users would engage in fortifying the map and crafting the resources they own in order to craft more defenses.

Class Diagrams - Lays out the 3 main classes that parent all the classes in the game.

ER Diagrams - Lays out how user progress would be stored in the Database we use (SQLite3).

Requirement Analysis Document - Lays out everything required for this project and how we intend on fulfilling those requirements.

User Case Diagram - Lays out exactly how the user would be interacting with the options (buttons, menus) they have to play the game, moving between rounds of enemies all while fortifying their defenses between rounds.
