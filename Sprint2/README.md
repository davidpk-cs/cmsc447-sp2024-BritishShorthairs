# IMPORTANT NOTE
* This project has many components, and currently two of these components have not been merged.
* In the homepage folder, there is our homepage as well as the start of the Production side of the game.
* In the Space Defender Demo folder, there is a demo of the Tower Defense side of the game.
* Both of these are important aspects of the game, and need to be run seperately.
